            <strong>The fetch returned something that is not Luau.</strong> A private repository, a
            wrong branch or file name, or a rate limit hands back an HTML error page, which never
            compiles. One line settles it:{" "}
            <C>print(game:HttpGet(url):sub(1, 120))</C>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The source really has a syntax error.</strong> Published files are compile-checked
