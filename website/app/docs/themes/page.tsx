          A theme table is a partial palette: keys you set are used, keys you leave out fall back to
          the base theme. That makes a one-line override — &quot;this hub is violet&quot; — a complete
          answer rather than a second full palette to maintain.

          These are the keys worth knowing. Everything a theme declares is a colour, a ColorSequence
          or a number the window reads once and binds wherever it is used.
