# Runtime test for the button's click choreography: the card and the compact
# row both press, run their callback, and spring back.

# The element used to call `motion.spec(...)` in its click handler without
# ever requiring the motion module, so the first tap died with "attempt to
# index nil with 'spec'" before the user's callback could run.
#
# Assembles: mini Roblox stubs + bundle (wrapped in a function to keep
# `local` scoping) + assertions, writes it to a temp file, and runs it under
# the Luau CLI from PATH if available, else /tmp/luau.
