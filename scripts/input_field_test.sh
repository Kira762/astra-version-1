# Runtime test for the input element's field: the box rounds with the theme's
# ElementCornerRadius (a theme binding, like every other surface) instead of a
# capsule of its own, and its width follows the text it shows - the placeholder
# while the field is empty, the typed text once it is not - up to a ceiling that
# answers to the page width. SetPlaceholder, a locale switch and a theme refresh
# all re-measure it.
#
# Assembles: mini Roblox stubs + bundle (wrapped in a function to keep
# `local` scoping) + assertions, writes it to a temp file, and runs it under
# the Luau CLI from PATH if available, else /tmp/luau.
