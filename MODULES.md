# Astra v1 — Module & Local Reference

A guide to every module in the modular tree and the meaning of its important
locals. After the minification pass, locals inside function bodies are renamed
to short names (`a1`, `a2`, … `a275`); this document explains what each
numbered local holds, per file, so future reviews don't have to reverse-engineer
the names. Top-level (file-scope) locals keep meaningful names — only
function-body locals were shortened.

Legend: locals are listed in declaration order per file/function. `self`
fields (`self.x`) are named as-is and not minified.

---

## Root

### `Types.luau`
Type definitions only (`export type ...`). No runtime locals.

### `library_entrypoint.luau`
Public API singleton. Key top-level locals:
- Requires — `core` (state/registry/loader), `core.state`, `images.image`, `utilities.locale`, `utilities.constants`, `icons`, `settings`, `Types`.
- Singleton bookkeeping: existing-window guard backed by a module-local `activeWindow` **and** a `getgenv()`-backed global store (key `__ASTRA_ACTIVE_WINDOW_V1`) so the anti-duplicate guard survives across `loadstring`ed instances; the `CreateWindow` dispatcher (pcall around `components.window.new`, re-throws on failure); the export table.
Exported names (typed surface is `Types.luau`'s `Astra`): `CreateWindow`, `Icons`; `Core` and `Settings` are also assigned on the table at runtime. There is no top-level `ChangeTheme`/`SetLocale`/`SetTranslator`/`RegisterTranslations`/`Unload` — those are window methods.
`CreateWindow` side effects: enforces the anti-duplicate guard (persisted `antiWindowDuplicate` setting, per-window opt-out via `settings.antiWindowDuplicate`), in secure mode preloads window images (`Image.preload` → failure `Notify`) and swaps in the brand fonts via `ChangeTheme({ Font, TitleFont })` when they load, then auto-`Show()`s the window one tick later (a `task.defer`, so a script that builds its tabs synchronously can finish first and the window appears once, fully populated; an explicit `Hide()` before that tick cancels it via `_autoShowCancelled`).

### `example.client.luau`
Usage example (not minified). Loads the bundle with `game:HttpGet` + `loadstring`, then builds a 20-tab window: Home, Controls, Appearance, Information, Changelog, Updates, plus 15 labelled test tabs. Demonstrates window tags, every element type, groups, console, and the `CreateChangelog` element (including a runtime `changelog:Add`), and ends with an explicit `home:Select()`.

---

## core/

### `core/init.luau`
- Requires `state`, `registry`, `loader` and exposes them as one table:
  `core.state`, `core.registry`, `core.loader` (the entrypoint and
  `components/*` consume it via `require(...core)`).

### `core/state.luau`
Shared runtime singletons:
- Roblox service fields: `localPlayer`, `coreGui`, `workspace`,
  `runService`, `userInputService`, `guiService`, `tweenService`,
  `httpService`, `textService`, `replicatedStorage`,
  `localizationService`, `guiContainer` (secure-mode aware).
- `secureMode` — platform detection; `fallbackFont` (default
  `Enum.Font.BuilderSans`) + `setFallbackFont(font)`; `brandFont(weight)` —
  font resolver honoring the platform's brand font override.
- Manager singletons: `fileSystemManager`, `assetResolver`, `fontManager`.

### `core/registry.luau`
- `a1..a3` — name→module map, lazy getter, registration list. `registerFactory` lets components override element factories.

### `core/loader.luau`
- `knownModules` — allow-list (`state`, `registry`); `loader.load(name)` requires a known core module exactly once (re-entrant guard + pcall re-throw).
- `loader.service(name, factory)` — registers an element factory override through the registry and returns it.

---

## components/

### `components/window.luau` (the largest module; class `Window`, minified as `a17`)
Constructor/`new` locals:
- `a2..a5` — `core.state`, `functions.colors`, `functions.textMetrics`, `utilities.layouts`.
- `a6..a14` — zIndex/display-order constants, default window props, layout-mode resolution.
- `a15` — `core.state` runtime table (services, localPlayer, tweenService…).
- `a4.toColorSequence` — gradient coercion helper for theme values.

Notable instance fields set in `new`: `screenGui`, `main`, `elements`,
`tabList`, `sidebar`, `settings` (plain table: `toggleKeybind`, `theme`,
`mouseOverride`, `keepOnScreen`, `welcomeToast`, `haptics`,
`dragMinimisedBar`, `showProfile`, `showFullUsername`,
`antiWindowDuplicate`, `layoutMode`, `activeSubTab`), `rfSettings` (the
built-in "General" settings tab), `_settingsTabs` (settings-tab list),
`_settingsMode` / `_previousTab` (settings-mode bookkeeping),
`settingsAction` / `minimiseAction` (topbar actions), `drag`,
`collapsedInteract`, `connections` / `instances` / `themeProperties` /
`localeProperties` / `controls` / `tabs` (lifecycle registries),
`Flags` (metatable view over `controls`).

Method map (names preserved through minification). Settings-related:
- `_buildSettingsUI` — creates the six built-in settings tab shells
  (General via `rfSettings`, plus Appearance, Behavior, Performance,
  Persistence, About; all `isSettingsTab`, `forgetState`). Rail/page order
  follows `customOrder` (General 1001 first, About 1006 last) so opening
  settings highlights the first rail row. Element content is built lazily:
  each tab stores a `_settingsContentBuilder` closure and
  `Window:_buildSettingsContent(tab)` runs it on the tab's first open
  (`Tab:Select`, after construction), so `CreateWindow` stays fast.
  Appearance hosts theme picker + Bar Layout picker (both
  popup-confirmed), the profile toggles (Show profile, Profile side
  Right/Left, Reveal profile details — refused with a "Show profile is
  required" notification while Show profile is off, and switched off with
  the card when Show profile goes off) and window toggles, Reset Window
  Position (recentres the window + card pair);
  Persistence always hosts saved-config Save/Load/Delete (independent of
  the `configuration` prop — paths fall back to the window name, and the
  dropdown shows its "No saved configurations" placeholder when none
  exist).
- `settingsAction` (topbar gear, `linkedTab = rfSettings`) — toggles
  settings mode via `_toggleSettingsMode` (shared with the profile
  panel's gear): entering shows only settings tabs and remembers the
  previous tab; a second click restores it.
- `_applySettingsLayout(active)` — reflows rail/elements for settings mode.
- `SaveSettings` / `LoadSettings` — per-window settings persistence via
  `utilities.persistence` (settings JSON, includes `activeSubTab` round-trip).
Public surface:
- `Create(className, props, themeBindings?)` — instance factory: theme-bound
  property recording (`themeProperties`), locale-token binding
  (`_bindLocale`), image-guessed property assignment; tracks every instance
  for `Unload`.
- `ChangeTheme`, `CreateTab`/`CreateSection`/`CreateTag`, `Notify`/`Toast`/
  `Popup`, `Show`/`Hide`/`ToggleHide`/`ToggleMinimise`, `Close` (animated
  close → `Unload`), `Save`/`Load`/`ListConfigs`/`DeleteConfig`/`GetPath`,
  `Get`/`Set`, `Navigate`, `SetLocale`/`SetTranslator`/
  `RegisterTranslations`, `ResolveIcon`, `SetProfile`, `Unload`.
- Lifecycle/extension helpers: `Connect`/`ConnectFor`/`Disconnect`/
  `DisconnectMany`, `DestroySubtree`/`DestroySubtrees`, `CreateGlow`,
  `CreateHoverOverlay`, `StyleElementBody`/`StyleElementPanel` (element
  gradient/corner/stroke styling), `_buildCompactRow` (settings-mode tab row).
Internal: `_reveal*`/`_fadeSurfaces`/`_firstShow`/`_quickRestore` (reveal
engine), `_bindTopbarDrag`/`_bindKeybind`/`_bindMouseOverride`,
`_applyWindowSize`/`_applyRailWidth`/`_clampToScreen`/`_watchViewport`,
`_clampedPosition` (keep-on-screen clamp — measures the window + profile-card
pair through `profilePanel.pairHalfSize`, so neither half can be dragged off
the edge), `_profileCenterPosition`/`_recenterForProfile` (window + profile-panel
recentering; re-derived by `_firstShow` and `_quickRestore` while the window is
still at its anchored resting spot, and by `ToggleMinimise`'s expand, which
re-clamps for the card that comes back), `_setLayoutMode`, `_toggleSettingsMode`
(topbar gear + profile panel gear), `_registerControl`/`_unregisterControl`/`_persist`,
`_runGuarded`, `_setElementLocked`/`_buildLockScrim`, `_updateWindowTitle`.

### `components/sidebar.luau`
Tab-rail reflow (the profile system moved to `components/profilePanel.luau`):
- `maskUsername(name)` — shared masking helper (first 3 chars + `****`), used by the profile panel.
- `buildTabRail` — rail ScrollingFrame + UIPadding + UIListLayout (the layout implementations build their own rails).
- `applyRailRows(window, width, layout)` — rows collapse only at the icon-only width (the responsive rail is often narrower than the old 219px fixed rail); ends with `tabSelector.relayoutSidebarRows`.

### `components/profilePanel.luau`
The profile panel — a compact 260x420 companion card floating beside the
window frame (a sibling in the same ScreenGui), exactly the default window's
height, replacing the in-window profile. It is built from the same tokens as
the window itself (WindowColor gradient surface, `CornerRoundness` corners,
SurfaceStroke, ShadowColor glow) so it reads as part of the shell rather than
a separate card, and it matches the design mock's structure:

- **Pinned header** — 48px avatar with a presence dot and hairline ring,
  left-aligned display name (`TitlingColor`, 15px) over the `@username`
  subtitle (12px, `ContentColor`), the PREMIUM pill when the platform
  reports a paid `MembershipType` (it rides the handle row and drops below
  the name only when it does not fit), and the settings gear. A 1px
  divider closes the header.
- **Scrolling details** — `ACCOUNT`, `CURRENT GAME`, `SERVER` and
  `USER SESSION` headings (muted, 10px, icon + label) over rounded
  `CardSurface` plates: User ID (with its COPY action), Join date, Account
  age, Friends and Followers, Key and Whitelist; the game thumbnail, name
  and Place ID; Players, Server ID and Server uptime; and the session
  timer. Only this region scrolls — the header never moves, the card never
  grows past the window's height, and the 6px themed scrollbar appears
  only once the content is taller than the region.

- `build(window, onOpenSettings)` — builds the surface, header, detail
  cards and tooltip; avatar with a generation guard via
  `images.image.avatar`; text truncated at end; the gear shares
  `Window:_toggleSettingsMode` (hover pill + stroke hover, pcalled).
  Mirrors `main`'s Position through property-change signals, so it follows
  drags/restores/resizes without a per-frame loop.
- `layout(window)` — places the fixed-size card on the selected side
  (`settings.profileSide`, default `"right"`) flush with the window edge
  (12px gap), vertically centred on the window's centre; re-flows the
  scroll region (and its scrollbar thickness) whenever the window height
  or the content changes, so the card never has to be taller than the
  window.
- `setShown(window, shown, info)` — effective = requested AND enabled AND
  window visible (not hidden/minimised); fades every registered target
  (panel pieces, text, gear, premium pill); idempotent (skips instances
  already at target).
- `applyLive(window)` — the 1s Heartbeat tick while the card is shown:
  player count (`#Players:GetPlayers()` / `MaxPlayers`), server uptime
  (`workspace.DistributedGameTime`), session time (`os.clock()` since the
  panel loaded) and the whitelist countdown. The connection is stored once
  in `window.profileRefreshConnection`.
- `isEnabled` / `isShown` / `shiftFor` — content-enabled check
  (`showProfile` on, player known, and the screen has horizontal room for
  window + gap + panel plus vertical room for the card's height — a space
  check, so landscape phones count), the same plus the window's own
  visibility (what the on-screen clamp asks: a minimised capsule is not
  shoved around by a card that is not there), and the off-centre shift
  `((260 + 12) / 2 = 136px)`, 0 while the panel is off.
- `pairHalfSize(window, width?, height?)` — how far the window + card pair
  reaches left, right and up/down from the window's centre: the card adds
  `width + gap` to its own side and, at 420px, can out-tall a short window.
  Plain window halves while the card is not shown. `Window:_clampedPosition`
  and the topbar drag both clamp with it, so "Keep window on screen" keeps
  the card on screen too.
- `setEnabled`, `setSide` — settings drivers (both recenter the window).
  `setEnabled` also raises a notification when the card is switched on but
  `hasRoom` fails, so an active toggle on a cramped viewport explains
  itself instead of showing nothing; switching the card *off* clears the
  reveal toggle with it (and says so), returning `revealCleared` so the
  settings UI can roll its switch back.
- `revealEnabled(window)` — the "Reveal profile details" toggle, still
  persisted under the legacy `showFullUsername` key.
- `revealAllowed` / `setReveal` / `syncReveal` — that toggle's dependency on
  `showProfile`: it unmasks values that live on the card, so `setReveal`
  refuses the on state while the card is off (setting stays off, card stays
  masked, "Show profile is required" notification, `false` returned so the
  caller rolls its switch back), and `syncReveal` normalises settings that
  arrive from disk with reveal = on and the card off (`Window:LoadSettings`).
- `applyIdentity(window)` — writes every identifying value on the card
  from the local player and that toggle: display name (headline) and
  @username (subtitle) through `sidebar.maskUsername`, user ID, place ID
  and server ID as a fixed `••••••` block, plus the COPY action (hidden
  while the user ID is masked, and it refuses to copy a masked value). An
  explicit `Window:SetProfile` subtitle is developer copy, so the toggle
  leaves it alone. Nil-safe on both the instances and the player; runs at
  the end of `build`, so the card never shows an unmasked value first.
- `applyCounts` / `applyLicense` — the live rows: players, uptime, session,
  key and whitelist. Astra ships no key store of its own, so the key and
  whitelist come from what the host handed to `Window:SetProfile` and read
  `—` when nothing was supplied. `applyLicense` takes
  `{ key, whitelist = { status, daysLeft | expiresAt } }` (`␣` the host's
  table, copied, never mutated): the whitelist row shows `14 days left`,
  `1 day left`, `Expired`, a non-"Active" status spelled out, or the
  placeholder.
- `setProfile` / `setSubtitle` / `refreshName` — `Window:SetProfile`
  accepts a string or `nil` (legacy: swaps only the subtitle line and
  leaves the host's key/whitelist rows alone), or a table
  (`{ subtitle, key, whitelist }`; omitted fields clear their rows).
  `refreshName` is kept as an alias for `applyIdentity`.
- `showTooltip` / `hideTooltip` — the card's own hover-help for values
  that do not fit their row (measured with `functions.textWidth`), shown
  on the card surface so the scroll region never clips it.

The window rests off-centre so window + gap + panel are centred as one unit
(`Window:_profileCenterPosition` / `Window:_recenterForProfile`): with the
panel on the right the window sits 136px left of screen centre, and
vice-versa. The resting centre is re-derived whenever the pair's state can
have changed while nothing was on screen to move — `_firstShow` (a player
turning up between the build and the first show), `_quickRestore` (a recenter
that ran while hidden only parks `_restorePosition`) and `_applyWindowSize`
(viewport changes) — but only while the window is still at its anchored
`0.5/0.5` spot, so a position the user dragged to is never overridden
(Reset Window Position recentres the pair on purpose). The panel hides when
the screen lacks room for the pair (portrait phones) and with
hide/minimise/close.

### `components/drag.luau`
- `utility` — `core.state` alias. Locals `a1..a8` — drag input state (start pos, delta thresholds, RenderStepped connection).

### `components/action.luau`, `chrome.luau`, `tabSelector.luau`
Small window-furniture classes; top-level `utility` require + constructor locals for created frames/buttons.

`tabSelector.railContentWidth(window, layout)` — natural rail width for the
responsive sidebar: the widest row in the current rail group (tabs or
settings tabs per `_settingsMode`), measured with `functions.textWidth`
(title + icon/spacing/paddings) plus row insets; 0 when the group is empty.
`Window:_railWidth` uses it to size the rail itself
(`min(content, floor(windowWidth / 2))` for the expanded responsive rail;
fixed widths elsewhere), and `tabSelector.relayoutSidebarRows` constrains an
overlong title to the row's remaining slot so its existing `TextWrapped`
wraps it in place. Re-derived from `sidebar.applyRailRows` (rail width
changes), `Window:_applyContentRailWidth` (layout/settings/locale/theme
changes, tab removal), `Tab:Remove`, `Window:SetLocale` and
`Window:ChangeTheme`. No-op for the topbar and collapsed-sidebar layouts.
`applyRailRows` treats the rail as collapsed only at the icon-only width
(`railCollapsedWidth`), so a content-sized rail narrower than the old fixed
219px still shows titles.

### `components/notification.luau`, `toast.luau`, `popup.luau`
Overlay queues: `a1..a4` — container frame, TweenInfo presets, queue table, active-instance guard.

### `components/search.luau`
Fuzzy search overlay: locals for candidate list, scoring weights, debounce connection.

---

## layouts/

One module per bar-layout mode, each with `Build(window, layout)` (creates the
tab strip and rail chrome) and `ApplyWidth(window)` (reflow):

- `Topbar.luau` — mode `top`: horizontal tab strip in the topbar.
- `Sidebar.luau` — mode `sidebar` (responsive): vertical tab rail.
- `SidebarCollapsed.luau` — mode `collapsedSidebar`: compact rail.

`utilities/layouts.luau` holds the per-mode metric tables and dispatches
(`layouts.get(mode)`, `layouts.implementation(mode)`,
`layouts.railWidthFor(layout, viewportWidth)`); `utilities/windowSizing.luau`
uses the same builders for responsive sizing. The window selects the
implementation in `_setLayoutMode`.

---

## elements/

All element classes share the pattern:
- First local — `require(...core.state)` alias.
- `new(tab, props)` — locals for normalized props, created frame, and connections.
- `_setShown`, `_refreshTheme`, `Set`/`Set_`-style setters keep their public names.

Per-element specifics:
- `toggle.luau` — track/knob frames, accent tween locals.
- `slider.luau` — fill frame, handle, drag math locals (`a1..a12`: range min/max, step, value normalization).
- `dropdown.luau` — button, list frame, option buttons, highlight.
- `input.luau` — TextBox, placeholder/focus locals, validation callback.
- `keybind.luau` — listening state flag, input connection.
- `colorpicker.luau` — HSV state, drag locals for hue/sv areas.
- `tab.luau` — tab class: `tabPage` (ScrollingFrame), `_register(element)` pipeline into `window.controls[flag]`, selector button visuals.
- `group.luau`, `section.luau`, `tabSection.luau` — container classes with UIListLayout locals.
- `console.luau` — output buffer table, max-lines constant, print hook.
- `changelog.luau` — release-history element (`__type = "Changelog"`): normalizes `ChangelogEntry`/`ChangelogChange` props, maps symbols (`+`/`-`/`~`, or words like "added"/"removed"/"changed") to green/red/amber, fades entries in, supports `Set`/`Refresh`/`Add(entry, prepend?)`/`Clear`.
- `descriptor.luau`, `divider.luau`, `progress.luau`, `stat.luau`, `tag.luau`, `text.luau`, `button.luau` — simple display/interaction elements.

---

## settings/

- `init.luau` — module wiring: exports the `manager`, `registry`, `defaults`,
  `persistence` modules plus `settings.newManager(overrides)` and
  `settings.readPersisted(key, default)` (used by the entrypoint for the
  anti-duplicate guard).
- `registry.luau` — `definitions`: one `{ key, kind, domain, description }`
  entry per setting. Keys: `toggleKeybind` (keybind/behavior),
  `mouseOverride` (boolean/behavior), `keepOnScreen` (boolean/appearance),
  `welcomeToast` (boolean/behavior), `haptics` (boolean/performance),
  `showProfile` (boolean/appearance), `showFullUsername` (boolean/appearance —
  documented as requiring `showProfile`, the rule `profilePanel.setReveal`
  enforces),
  `antiWindowDuplicate` (boolean/behavior), `layoutMode` (enum/appearance),
  `activeSubTab` (enum/appearance — persisted, retained for compatibility
  with the pre-rebuild sub-tab UI). Lookup: `registry.definition(key)`,
  `registry.keys()`.
- `defaults.luau` — `values`: flat defaults (`toggleKeybind = Enum.KeyCode.K`,
  `layoutMode = "top"`, `activeSubTab = 1`, …); `defaults.clone(overrides)`.
- `manager.luau` — `SettingsManager.new(overrides)` → `{ defaults =
  defaults.clone(overrides), persistence = {} }`; methods `get`, `set`
  (routes through `registry.definition` + the domain validator, returns false
  for unknown keys), `reset`, `onChange(listener)`, `save`, `load`.
- `persistence.luau` — save/load/read of the per-window settings JSON over
  `utilities.persistenceSettings` (round-trips `activeSubTab` and friends).
- `appearance.luau`, `behavior.luau`, `performance.luau` — per-domain
  `validate(key, value) -> (ok, normalized)`. Appearance additionally
  whitelists `layoutMode ∈ { top, sidebar, collapsedSidebar }` and floors
  `activeSubTab` to an integer ≥ 1.

---

## functions/

- `init.luau` — re-export table: `textWidth`, `textHeight`,
  `deriveFlagFromName`, `contrastColor`, `toColorSequence`, `contrastText`.
- `colors.luau` — `toColorSequence` (Color3/ColorSequence pass-through),
  `contrastColor` (black/white by luminance), `contrastText` (dark/white for
  text overlays).
- `textMetrics.luau` — text width/height estimation via `TextService`.
- `flagNames.luau` — control-flag (config key) sanitizer/uniquer.

---

## images/ & cache/

- `init.luau` — folder module: re-exports the image helpers
  (`resolve`, `assign`, `preload`, `avatar`, `rewrites`) alongside
  `windowIcons`.
- `image.luau` — `assign` (guarded property write), `resolve` (value →
  loadable image URL), `avatar(userId, callback)` — returns cached URI or
  `""`, fires callback after fetch; empty final URI → caller uses plate
  fallback; `preload(callback)` — batch preload reporting
  `(failedCount, failedRoles)`; `rewrites`/`onBlock`/`pending` — URL
  rewrites, blocklist hook, in-flight tracking.
- `windowIcons.luau` — asset-id registry for built-in chrome icons (settings,
  close, minimize, profile placeholder, …).
- `cache/imageCache.luau` — disk/memory cache; `pcall(callback, uri or "")` at the end of the retry chain.
- `cache/moduleCache.luau`, `persistenceCache.luau`, `init.luau` — generic memoization layers.

---

## icons/

- `init.luau` — public surface (`get`, `resolve`, `getByPack`, `list`,
  `packs`, `count`, `isPack`) with lazy metatables per pack: a pack's data
  module is required on first lookup, then cached (`packLoaders` /
  `loadedPacks`). Resolution pipeline: pack values are repo-relative PNG
  paths under `assets/icons/<pack>-pack/<first-letter>/`; `resolve` maps them
  onto the repo's raw-GitHub base URL (`assetBase`), honours an executor
  `getcustomasset` override (cached in `customAssetCache`, folder
  `custom_asset`), and passes numeric asset ids through unchanged;
  `namedAssets` covers a few named chrome assets.
- `lucide/feather/material/phosphor/heroicons/tabler.luau` — pure data tables
  `{ [name] = "assets/icons/..." }`. Names are public lookup keys; never
  renamed. Entry counts: lucide 1776, tabler 5130, phosphor 1512,
  heroicons 324, feather 287, material 299.

---

## themes/

- `init.luau` — resolution engine: module table, ColorSequence-key
  whitelist, `coerceValue`, `firstColor`, `deriveStrokes`
  (luminance-based stroke deriver), `resolve` (clones `default`, overlays
  chosen theme, so custom tables inherit missing keys).
- `default.luau` + 9 themes (`amethyst`, `cobalt`, `crimson`, `ember`,
  `emerald`, `frost`, `gold`, `onyx`, `rose`) — theme tables of ~65 keys
  (surfaces, strokes, text colors, gradients, fonts, corner radii,
  slider/toggle/picker styling). Keys a theme omits are inherited from the
  `default` clone. Registered in two places: the settings-UI theme table in
  `components/window.luau` and the persisted-theme whitelist in
  `utilities/persistenceSettings.luau`.
  `CardSurface` (Color3, from the `2ecd628` settings-card fix) is still
  defined in every theme but no longer referenced by the rebuilt settings
  UI — kept for compatibility.

---

## utilities/ (selected)

- `constants.luau` — static constants incl. `icons` map (with `profileAvatarPlaceholder`).
- `persistenceSettings.luau` — settings JSON encode/decode; `activeSubTab` round-trips here.
- `persistenceWrite.luau` — atomic write helper.
- `persistenceConfig.luau`, `persistencePaths.luau` — window-config serialization and key paths.
- `persistence.luau` — facade re-exporting the config + settings persistence
  surface (`getPath`, `save`, `load`, `applyTo`, `list`, `delete`,
  `getSettingsPath`, `saveSettings`, `loadSettings`); required by the window
  and by `settings/persistence`.
- `layouts.luau` — per-mode metric tables (`chromeHeight`, `fadeSize`,
  `cardCorners`, …) and dispatch into the `layouts/` builders
  (`get`, `implementation`, `railWidthFor`).
- `HapticEngine.luau` — vibration wrappers guarded by service availability.
- `moveable.luau`, `lockable.luau` — drag/lock mixins.
- `log.luau` — warn/error/log with Astra prefix.
- `locale.luau` — translation table + `SetTranslator` support.
- `filesystem.luau`, `filesystemManager.luau` — RobloxFS abstraction (isFolder/WriteFile wrappers, secure-mode aware).
- `assetResolver.luau`, `network.luau`, `services.luau` — platform layer (HTTP fetch with retries, service singletons).
- `windowSizing.luau` — responsive size computation (desktop tiers around the
  600x420 default, min/max protected) plus the fixed mobile profile returned
  for touch-only phone-sized viewports (`isMobileViewport`).
- `enums.luau`, `ordering.luau`, `odometer.luau`, `fontManager.luau`, `functions.luau` (legacy shim), `path.luau` — small helpers.

---

## scripts/ (verification + previews)

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `generate_bundle.js` | Rebuilds `version-1.luau` from the modular tree. |
| `check_requires.py` | Static require graph: every module resolves, no cycles. |
| `check_instance_fields.py` | Fails on custom-field writes on instances (the `_profileGeneration` crash class). |
| `profile_{compact,centering,reveal,details}_test.sh` | Profile card suites: geometry/visibility, window-pair centring, the reveal toggle, and the redesigned card (tokens, pinned header + scrolling, live server/session values, license rows, tooltip, no-player case). |
| `sidebar_tab_sizing_test.sh`, `smoke_test_bundle.sh` | Rail sizing and a bundle smoke run. |
| `profile_panel_preview.sh` | Builds the real card under the mini Roblox stubs, dumps it as JSON and renders `assets/profile-panel-preview{,-revealed}.png` (needs Pillow) — the fastest way to eyeball a layout change without Roblox. |

All of them assemble `scripts/sidebar_sizing_stubs.luau` + `version-1.luau`
(so regenerate the bundle after a source edit) and run under the Luau CLI.

## Naming conventions after minification

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `a1`–`aN` (file-scope) | top-level requires, in require order |
| `a1`–`aN` (in-function) | per-function locals, in declaration order |
| `self`, method names | untouched (public/private API surface) |
| Roblox property string keys | untouched |
| Icon-name strings, config flags | untouched (data) |

When touching a minified file, re-minify only that file, then
`luau-compile` it and run `scripts/check_requires.py`,
`scripts/check_instance_fields.py`, and `node scripts/generate_bundle.js`.
(Validate against the full tree with `scripts/smoke_test_bundle.sh`.)
