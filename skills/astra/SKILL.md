# Astra v1

Astra is a Roblox/Luau UI library for executor scripts. One public entry point —
`Astra:CreateWindow(props)` — then a window owns tabs, tabs own elements, and
every element is created from a single props table. Everything below is the API
surface that actually exists; do not invent parallel methods or props.

## Load the library

```lua
local Astra = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kira762/astra-version-1/main/version-1.luau"))()
```

Three details are load-bearing:

- **The trailing `()` is required.** `loadstring(text)` only compiles and returns
  a chunk; calling it runs Astra and returns the module table. Without the call,
  every later `Astra:CreateWindow` fails with `attempt to index a function value`.
- **Fetch the bundle, never the modular tree.** `version-1.luau` is the generated
  artifact (see `scripts/generate_bundle.js`); `core/`, `elements/` and friends are
  source for building it.
- **The URL must be the raw file of a public repo**, and `HttpService` requests
  must be enabled in the runtime.

Inside Studio/Rojo (no `loadstring`) the same library is a ModuleScript:
`require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Astra)`.

A failed load looks like `rAnDoMcHuNkNaMe:1: attempt to call a nil value` — that is
the *loader*, not an Astra bug. It means the fetched text never compiled, usually
because the fetch returned an HTML error page (private repo, wrong branch, rate
limit). Confirm with `print(game:HttpGet(url):sub(1, 120))`. Inside this repo, run
`sh scripts/check_syntax.sh` and regenerate with `node scripts/generate_bundle.js`.

## Minimal working script

```lua
local Astra = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kira762/astra-version-1/main/version-1.luau"))()

local window = Astra:CreateWindow({
    name = "Example Hub",
    subtitle = "v1.0",
    icon = "house",
})

local tab = window:CreateTab({ name = "Home", icon = "house" })

tab:CreateButton({
    name = "Say hello",
    icon = "play",
    callback = function()
        window:Notify({ title = "Hello", content = "Your first element works." })
    end,
})

tab:CreateToggle({
    name = "Auto Sprint",
    flag = "autoSprint",
    value = false,
    callback = function(on) print("Auto Sprint:", on) end,
})

tab:Select()
```

The first tab opens on its own and layout is a user setting (**Settings → Appearance
→ Bar Layout**), so there is no layout prop and no sub-tab API to wire up.

## Rules that prevent most broken scripts

1. **One props table, always.** Every constructor is `parent:CreateX({ ... })`.
   Positional arguments are not supported.
2. **Colons on library calls.** `Astra:CreateWindow`, `window:CreateTab`,
   `window:Notify`, `tab:CreateButton`, `handle:Set(...)`.
3. **Create the parent first.** Elements are created on a **Tab** (or on a
   **Group** created by a tab). `CreateCollapsibleGroup` exists *only* on a tab.
4. **Keep the returned handles.** They are objects with methods (`:Set`, `:Add`,
   `:Remove`, `:Refresh`, `:MoveUp`, `:Lock`, …), not plain data.
5. **Window methods live on the window**: `window:ChangeTheme`, `window:SetLocale`,
   `window:Notify`, `window:Popup`, `window:Get`/`Set`. There is no
   `Astra.ChangeTheme` or `Astra.Unload`.
6. **Never build a second live window by accident.** With the default
   `antiWindowDuplicate` setting on, a new `Astra:CreateWindow` unloads the existing
   window first. Reuse the handle, call `window:Unload()`, or opt out per window
   with `settings = { antiWindowDuplicate = false }`.
7. **Flags are shared key space.** Give every control that must restore a unique,
   stable `flag`; elements with `forgetState = true` stay out of save/load.
8. **Icons are pack-qualified or global, and case-sensitive.** A bare name is
   searched across lucide, material, tabler, phosphor, heroicons, feather, remix in that
   order; `"tabler:home"` pins one pack. An unresolved value is returned unchanged,
   so a typo silently yields a bad image, not an error — check with
   `Astra.Icons.get("house")`.
9. **Animate through the motion service**, not ad-hoc TweenInfos, so user motion
   settings apply: `Astra.Motion.tween(instance, { BackgroundTransparency = 0.5 }, "snappy", onComplete)`.
   Specs: `instant, fast, snappy, normal, smooth, emphasized, pop, glide, exit, spring, settle, spin, drift`.
10. **Expect startup to be staged.** Constructors return fully built objects but may
    yield while the first UI is built, the window auto-shows on the next frame, and
    `Notify` overlays are queued one at a time (a backlog past six drops the oldest).
    `window:Hide()` before the first reveal cancels auto-show.

## Failure signatures

| What you see | What it means |
|---|---|
| `attempt to index a function value` on the loader line | The `()` after `loadstring(...)` is missing, so `Astra` is a chunk, not the module table. |
| `rAnDoMcHuNkNaMe:1: attempt to call a nil value` | The fetched text never compiled — usually an HTML error page (private repo, wrong branch, rate limit) or a broken bundle. `print(game:HttpGet(url):sub(1, 120))`. |
| `attempt to call a nil value` after loading | The method does not exist on that parent: `CreateCollapsibleGroup` on a Group, `CreateTab` on `Astra`, or props passed positionally. |
| An element renders a blank or broken icon | The icon name resolved to nothing and was passed through unchanged — check case, pack and spelling with `Astra.Icons.get`. |
| Values do not come back on the next run | No `flag` on the control, a duplicated flag, `forgetState = true`, or Auto Load turned off in Settings → Persistence. |
| Two shells appear at once | A second `CreateWindow` after the guard was disabled or the previous handle was left live — reuse the handle or `window:Unload()` first. |
| A control ignores clicks | It is `:Lock()`ed, or its tab has never been shown (inactive tabs reveal and build lazily). |
| A popup or notification never appears | Overlays are queued one at a time; a burst past six waiting requests drops the oldest unbuilt one. |

## Element cheat sheet

`flag`, `icon` and `name` are accepted almost everywhere; `description` is a helper
line on `CreateCollapsibleGroup`.

| Create on Tab / Group | Key props | Handle methods |
|---|---|---|
| `CreateSection({ name, icon })` | heading band for a part of the page | — |
| `CreateText({ name, text, icon })` | body copy card | `:Set(text)`, `:SetTitle(name)` |
| `CreateButton({ name, icon, callback, tapIcon })` | `tapIcon = false` hides the built-in tap glyph, a name or asset id replaces it | — |
| `CreateToggle({ name, value, flag, callback })` | fires `callback(on)` | `:Set(on, skipCallback?)` |
| `CreateSlider({ name, range = { min, max }, value, increment, suffix, minimal, flag, callback })` | `callback(value, dragging)` | `:Set(value)` |
| `CreateDropdown({ name, options, value, multiSelect, placeholder, flag, callback })` | multi-select value is a table | `:Refresh(options)`, `:Add(option)`, `:Remove(option)` |
| `CreateInput({ name, value, placeholder, numeric, clearOnFocus, flag, callback })` | text field, `callback(text)` | `:Set(text)` |
| `CreateStat({ name, value, prefix, suffix, display, compact, letter, changeMode, changeBaseline })` | readout card; a string `value` shows one letter unless `letter = false`, which reads the whole value | `:Set(value)`, `:SetText(text)`, `:ResetBaseline(n)` |
| `CreateDivider({ text, line, spacing })` | rule between controls | — |
| `CreateGroup({ direction = "row" \| "column" })` | horizontal row by default | nesting via `Create…` |
Tab-only declarative container: `tab:CreateCollapsibleGroup({ name, icon, description, elements = { ... } })`
where each child is `{ type = "Toggle" | "Button" | "Slider" | "Dropdown" | "Input" | "Switch" | "Stat" | "Section" | "Text" | "Divider" | "Group" | "Changelog", ...same props }`.
Groups may nest inside it; collapsible groups never nest, and every collapsible
starts collapsed. `Changelog` renders as a regular element wherever it is declared.

Elements support `:MoveTo(index)`, `:MoveUp()`, `:MoveDown()`, `:MoveToTop()`,
`:MoveToBottom()`; most also support `:Lock()`, `:Unlock()`, `:IsLocked()`.

## Window surface in one glance

`window:CreateTab`, `CreateSection`, `Notify`, `Popup`, `Navigate(tab)`,
`Show`, `Hide`, `ToggleHide`, `ToggleMinimise`, `Close`, `Save(name?)`, `Load(name?)`,
`ListConfigs`, `DeleteConfig(name)`, `Get(flag)`, `Set(flag, value)`, `Flags`,
`ChangeTheme(theme)`, `SetLocale(id)`, `SetTranslator(fn)`, `RegisterTranslations(t)`,
`ResolveIcon(value, pack?)`, `GetPath()`, `Unload()`, plus `SetProfile({ subtitle, key, tier, whitelist })`.

Built-in Settings live behind the gear action (General, Appearance, Persistence,
About) and hold menu keybind, window behaviour, motion, themes, bar layout, profile
card, auto save/load. They are window-scoped — user code does not build them.

## References

Read only what the task needs:

- `references/elements.md` — full props and handle methods for every element, plus
  tab/group rules and the Collapsible Group declarative schema.
- `references/window.md` — window methods, popups/notifications, themes,
  icon packs, motion service, localisation, profile card, persistence, startup pacing.
- `references/repo-workflow.md` — working inside this repository: bundle generation,
  syntax and checker scripts, runtime tests, docs/changelog conventions.
- `assets/example-window.luau` — a single-file, copy-pasteable hub covering every
  element type. It is Luau-parsed, but `scripts/check_syntax.sh` only walks the
  library paths, so compile it directly after editing.
