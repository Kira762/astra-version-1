# Astra v1

[![skills.sh](https://skills.sh/b/Kira762/astra-version-1)](https://skills.sh/Kira762/astra-version-1)

A Roblox/Luau interface library for executor scripts: one loader line, one
`CreateWindow` call, and tabs full of elements — buttons, toggles, sliders,
dropdowns, inputs, stats, text, dividers, groups, collapsible
groups and changelog — with built-in settings, themes, icon packs, saved configs and staged
startup.

## Use the library

```lua
local Astra = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kira762/astra-version-1/main/version-1.luau"))()

local window = Astra:CreateWindow({ name = "Example Hub", subtitle = "v1.0" })
local tab = window:CreateTab({ name = "Home", icon = "house" })

tab:CreateButton({
    name = "Say hello",
    icon = "play",
    callback = function() window:Notify({ title = "Hello", content = "It works." }) end,
})

tab:Select()
```

Two things have to be right: the runtime must provide `loadstring` (executors do,
plain Studio does not) and `HttpService` requests must be enabled. In Studio/Rojo
the same library is a ModuleScript — `require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Astra)`.
Always load the published bundle `version-1.luau`; the modular folders are its
source, not a runtime entry point.

## What is in the box

| Area | Highlights |
|---|---|
| Window | Topbar / sidebar / collapsed-sidebar layouts, minimise-to-capsule, draggable, notifications, modal popups, search, profile card, per-window settings. |
| Elements | Section, Text, Button, Toggle (and `Switch` alias), Slider, Dropdown (single + multi-select, searchable), Input, Stat, Divider, Group, Collapsible Group, Changelog. |
| State | Flags with built-in auto save/load, named configs, `forgetState` opt-out, writable-storage persistence. |
| Look | 10 built-in themes plus custom theme tables, seven icon packs (lucide, material, tabler, phosphor, heroicons, feather, remix) and a `custom_asset/` folder override. |
| Motion | One motion service behind every transition, driven by the user's animation-speed setting. |

## Install the agent skill

This repository is also an [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io) source. The skill
teaches coding agents how to build Astra interfaces and how to work on the library
itself, so they stop guessing at the API:

```sh
# install everything this repo publishes (currently just `astra`)
npx skills add Kira762/astra-version-1

# non-interactive, for a specific set of agents
npx skills add Kira762/astra-version-1 --skill astra -a claude-code -a cursor -y
```

## Documentation

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) | The author-facing guide: loading, building windows, every element, flags, themes, icons, motion, localisation, settings. |
| [MODULES.md](MODULES.md) | Module-by-module reference, including the meaning of minified locals. |
| [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) | Dated entries explaining each behaviour change. |
| [PERFORMANCE_CHANGES.md](PERFORMANCE_CHANGES.md) | Startup and instance-budget work with measured numbers. |
| [assets/icons/README.md](assets/icons/README.md) | Visual icon catalog with copyable names across all seven packs. |
| [example.client.luau](example.client.luau) | End-to-end example that builds every element type in one tab. |
| [changelog.example.luau](changelog.example.luau) | Host-side changelog data file consumed by the Changelog element. |
| [website/](website/README.md) | The docs site: multi-page guide, search, live window preview, published to GitHub Pages. |

## Docs website (GitHub Pages)

The usage guide is also a static site: <https://kira762.github.io/astra-version-1/>

It is a multi-page docs site — sidebar navigation, ⌘K search over every page and
heading, on-page contents, copy buttons on code blocks, and a landing page whose
hero is an interactive rebuild of an Astra window (the theme chips use the ten
built-in themes' real accent colours). One tree in `website/lib/docs.ts` drives the
sidebar, the search index, the previous/next pager and `sitemap.xml`.

It is a Next.js app in `website/` that exports to `website/out/`, published by
[.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml](.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml) on every
push to `main` that touches `website/**`. No other host, no build output committed,
and nothing outside `website/` is ever uploaded.

One-time switch for the repo owner — Settings → Pages → Build and deployment →
Source: **GitHub Actions** (<https://github.com/Kira762/astra-version-1/settings/pages>).
Because a project site is served from the `/astra-version-1` sub-path, the workflow
exports `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` so every asset URL is prefixed; building without it
produces a page with no CSS.

```sh
npm run build:pages    # reproduce the Pages build locally → website/out/
cd website && npm run dev   # local dev at http://localhost:3000
```

Details and troubleshooting: [website/README.md](website/README.md).

```

## Development

```sh
node scripts/generate_bundle.js             # regenerate version-1.luau from the tree
sh scripts/check_syntax.sh                  # compile every published .luau file
python3 scripts/check_requires.py           # require paths and cycles
python3 scripts/check_instance_fields.py    # no custom fields written on Instances
sh scripts/smoke_test_bundle.sh             # runtime smoke test of the bundle
sh scripts/<feature>_test.sh                # per-feature runtime tests
```

`check_syntax.sh` and the runtime tests need the [Luau CLI](https://github.com/luau-lang/luau/releases)
(`luau-compile`, or `luau --compile`) in `PATH`, `/tmp` or `/usr/local/bin`; without
it the gate reports "not checked" (exit 2) rather than passing silently. A behaviour
change is only complete once `CHANGELOG.md` and the docs that describe it are updated.
